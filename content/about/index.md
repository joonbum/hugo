I am an Associate Scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have over 10 years of experience conducting Human Factors research involving traffic safety. I have served as a project manager/principal investigator on several Human Factors projects for US DOT and industry clients. Before joining the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I worked at MIT as a postdoctoral associate (2014-2016) and at Battelle Memorial Institute as a Principal Research Scientist (2016-2020). 

My background is in human factors and driving safety, and I have experience in research design and statistical analysis of time course behavioral data, based upon visual, physiological, and performance measures in the driving research domain. Also I have extensive experience processing and analyzing Naturalistic Driving Study data (e.g., SHRP2 and NEST) to understand drivers' risky behavior and visual attention allocation.

My broad research interests are in driving safety and predictive modeling. Research topics that I am currently focusing on include:
- Driver-automation teaming
- Designing driver-automation cooperation
- Human-Machine Interface strategies to overcome situation awareness deficiency after disengagement in automated vehicles
- Applications of advanced modeling to understand drivers' interaction with manual or partially automated vehicles

I provide free consulting for literally any students who need advices on their academic/career journeys on every Monday (1pm-1:30pm CST). Feel free to schedule a meeting with me using this [link.](https://calendly.com/joonbum/15min)
