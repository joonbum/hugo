I'm an Associate Scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with over a decade of experience in Human Factors research, particularly in traffic safety. I've led projects for the US DOT and industry clients, managing and investigating various aspects of Human Factors. Prior to my current role, I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT (2014-2016) and a Principal Research Scientist at Battelle Memorial Institute (2016-2020).

My research interests focus on driving safety, particularly in areas such as driver-automation collaboration, designing effective human-machine interfaces, and applying advanced statistics to study drivers' interaction with manual or partially automated vehicles.
