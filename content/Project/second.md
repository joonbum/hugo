__Overview__:
The objective of this project was to conduct analyses of the SHRP 2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data to examine the effects of specific roadway locations and infrastructure features on episodic speeding by NDS participants in and around Seattle, Washington. In Phase 1, the type and quantity of data available from the NDS and Roadway Databases were determined. Data analyses and countermeasure development, implementation, and assessment are being conducted over Phases 2 and 3.
