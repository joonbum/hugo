title: Effects of Education on Speeding Behavior 
---
#### Sponsor: NCHRP
#### Role: Principal investigator

__Overview__:
The objective of this project is to improve NHTSAâ€™s understanding of the effectiveness of driver education about vehicle speeds, laws, and the risks of speeding behavior in improving driver knowledge and changing driver attitudes and behaviors, including its effectiveness in reducing post-education speeding recidivism. Participants will drive their own instrumented vehicles for one month before and one month after taking an education course, and their speeding behavior will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the instruction component.
