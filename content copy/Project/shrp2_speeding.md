__Abstract__:
Speeding-related crashes continue to be a serious problem in the United States and attempts to address this
problem through a variety of approaches have not led to a substantial reduction in speed-related fatalities. A better
understanding of speeding behavior is needed to inform the development of new speeding countermeasures. To
address this issue, researchers conducted an in-depth investigation of driver speeding behavior using SHRP2 NDS
data, which included numerous observations across various situations, environments, and driver characteristics.
The research activities encompassed several steps. Sampling and data processing activities were conducted to
obtain a set of trips that was suitable for examining multiple aspects of speeding. Key measures were then
extracted from the trip data, including: (a) periods in which drivers had an opportunity to speed (which served as
an exposure measure), and (b) speeding episodes within those periods. Using these data elements, situational and
driver-specific predictors of speeding were examined using descriptive statistics and regression analyses. In
addition, speeding episodes were used to identify different types of speeding and to develop a typology of
speeders. Five types of speeders were identified, and these groups differed in terms of their aggregate speeding
behavior, demographic characteristics, and attitudes about speeding and risk taking.
