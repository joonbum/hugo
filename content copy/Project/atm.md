title: Principles and Guidance for Presenting Drivers with Dynamic Information on Active Traffic Management (ATM)
---
#### Sponsor: NCHRP
#### Role: Project manager

__Overview__:
The objective of this project was to improve the effectiveness of ATM strategies, which includes systems to manage congestion, incidents, weather, special events, and work zones. The research explored several research questions such as: (a) what information related to ATM strategies does a driver want and need, (b) how much information can a driver process via the complementary and contrasting modalities, (c) what existing and potential ATM media could be used to deliver this information, and (d) how can an agency balance the needs of drivers and the infrastructure costs.
